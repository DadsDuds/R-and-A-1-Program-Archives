# The following files are crucial to this GUI to work. This GUI has six slide bars, radio buttons, and buttons that perform different actions to the Braccio arm.
# The python program is responsible for not only the GUI, but the angles for set positions and other aspects.
# The arduino program is responsible for receiving information from the python program in order to move the motors on the arm.
# I'm leaving this here in case a future program/project is assigned that requires a GUI that does this.
